# bluescout
script to help with scouting FRC events using tbapy

bluescout generates a .txt file with a list of matches that your team is in at an event.

### dependencies
python (i recommend python 3.11. 3.12 may work, but i have not tested it)

[Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

tbapy ([repo](https://github.com/frc1418/tbapy))
```
pip install tbapy
```

### how to run
1. download bluescout.py
2. run bluescout.py - i recommend making a specific directory for it because it generates a new file for each event

### todo
:black_square_button: print data on md or html file instead of plain text
